# Personalized UX

An old toy project to demonstrate how ML could be used to personalize the UX on a per user basis.

Very dumb use case here:
1. First there is a learning phase, where you have to handle your device in the left hand, right hand, and then put it down. During this phase, the app records data (basically accelerometer data)
2. Then, a classifier is trained with this data
3. The UX of the app changes, depending of how you hold your device
